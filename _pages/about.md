I am Siddharth Ramnarayanan. I am a student at the International School Bangalore. I study in 9th grade. I have experience various part of robotics and hardware building. Namely Arduino, Raspberry PI, python, java, Lego Mindstorms. Some others are managing, shortlisting, planning, this is what I learnt when I lead my FLL robotics team Martians to the international level, I have been teaching Lego Mindstorms for a year with young intelligent minds. Team leading isnâ€™t exactly easy because I had to work very late night even on school days but I kept persisting because it is something I am passionate about. I have also participated in WRO. I am also good with using complex concept in my robot like integrating trigonometry and similar triangle concept because then the robot would do the same thing every time because new values are calculated every time and there is only one fixed value and the other change according to sensor reading. I have also done some video and image editing to broaden my skillset.
